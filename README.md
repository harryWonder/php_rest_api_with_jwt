This is a rest api i made using php and jwt for a web project that needs
to fetch it's data from another location. I only made this up to the
point of the generateToken api. I would do a refactor the code later
to have it do full CRUD

Calling the generate Token api example :

{
    "name": "generateToken",
    "param": {
        "appName" : "Registered application name goes here" //Make sure this field exists in the webcustomer table...
        "apUrl" : "Registered url from the application making the call goes here" //This too must be registered in the webcustomers table...
    }
}


You can write me personally if you have an issues using this api at stephenilori458@gmail.com.. I would be happy to debug with you.. Yours in code Ilori stephen adejuwon.
